### **üîπ Vixen Agent Development: Secure Outline & Next Steps**  
(*Locking in the original direction so nothing gets lost or twisted.*)  

---

## **‚úÖ What We‚Äôve Built So Far**  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Core Framework (Working & Stable)**
- **Agent Base**: Handles commands, structured responses, and LLM integration (Ollama).  
- **Task System**: Background tasks run on schedule and persist across restarts.  
- **Memory System**: Stores user preferences, conversation history, and completed tasks.  

---

## **üîÑ What Needs Fixing (Last Known Issues)**
> *These are small but critical bugs that need to be resolved before moving forward.*
  
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Memory System (Partial Fix Needed)**
- **Issue**: Context retrieval was broken due to incorrect list handling.  
- **Cause**: `"context"` stored incorrectly as a dictionary key instead of a list.  
- **Fix Status**: Mostly resolved, but `"add_entry"` still needs verification.  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Task System (Needs Refinement)**
- **Issue**: Task shortcut detection works, but task execution logic might need improvements.  
- **Cause**: Task persistence is stable, but auto-recovery logic isn't fully tested.  
- **Fix Status**: Functional but needs stress testing.

## **üîú What Comes Next (Next Steps in Order)**  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Finalize Memory System**
- **Ensure context is stored & retrieved correctly.**
- **Verify ‚Äúadd_entry‚Äù updates context & saves properly.**  
- **Confirm task history is correctly logged in memory.**  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Refine Task System**
- **Stress-test auto-recovery:**  
  - Does it restart failed tasks?  
  - Does it detect missing tasks on startup?  
- **Improve shortcut handling for task commands.**  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Expand Agent Reasoning & Decision-Making**
- **Fine-tune structured reasoning responses.**  
- **Improve adaptive memory recall (context-aware responses).**  

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Introduce Safe-Mode Recovery**
- **If the agent crashes, it should auto-disable failing components.**  
- **Log failure states for debugging.**  

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ System Monitoring & Logging**
- **Real-time logs for memory, tasks, and system status.**  
- **CPU & memory tracking for performance optimization.**  

---

## **‚è≠Ô∏è Future Expansions (After Core Fixes)**
(*Once everything above is stable, we go next-gen.*)  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Dynamic Personality & Adaptive Memory**
- **Agent adapts to user over time** (custom personality shaping).  
- **Adjusts responses based on past interactions.**  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Hybrid AI Framework (Multi-Agent Capabilities)**
- **Ability to switch between LLMs dynamically (Ollama, DeepSeek, etc.).**  
- **Modular execution of different AI components (reasoning, creativity, planning).**  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Full Offline Autonomy**
- **Agent can operate without external API dependencies.**  
- **Self-contained execution with advanced decision-making.**  

---

### **üìù Final Notes**
- This locks in **my original direction** so nothing gets lost.  
- **Next immediate priority:** **Memory system fixes, then task refinement.**  
- **After that:** Expand agent reasoning & introduce safe-mode recovery.
